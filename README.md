This is my version of the Node-Chat-App from Andrew J. Meade's node course.

The parts of this that are my work

- Added default set of rooms

- Get list of rooms from server

- Added a menu to the sidebar allowing a user to add a new room or exit the chat.

- Added a dropdown menu of default rooms and active rooms to the log-in screen

- Added room name normalization.

- Added unit tests for:
  + getRoomsList function which fetches the rooms from the server.
  + uniqueUserName validation
